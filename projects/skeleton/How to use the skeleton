How to use the skeleton
1) Make a copy of your skeleton directory. Rename to new project name.
2) Rename the NAME directory to the name of the project/name of the root module.
3) Edit setup.py to have all the information for the project
4) Rename tests/NAME_tests.py to also have the module name
5) Double check using nosetests
    nosetests needs to be called in the skeleton directory (1 level above the "tests" directory)
      Should output "Ran 1 test in <time>"
6) All good to start coding
